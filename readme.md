# cellent AG Typescript and Sass (Scss) Build template using gulp

This template can be used for building typescript and/or sass.

You can configure our requirements to Typescript by editing the tsconfig.json.

## Configure Gulp Build

If you need to change settings or want to disable or enable an option you only have to edit the config.json file.

## Output directory

The default output for compiled sources are located in "/dist".

## Package manager

according to the cellent web guidelines the template is using [NPM](https://npmjs.org) as package manger. We do not use any other package manager like bower because currently it is without any added value to our needs.
